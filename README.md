# TrackItUp Proposal

## Team Workflow Strategy

We will be using the methodology of Feature Branching wherein the master branch will be updated when the corresponding feature branch is tested and is ready without any errors.

## General Responsibilities


Each member of the team is responsible for working on a individual feature or functionality

#### **TEAM:**
1. Will B. - Backend Framework
2. Monisha S. - Frontend Framework
3. Yashwanth T. - Frontend Framework

## Development Tools:
* IDE - Visual Studio Code
* Frontend - HTML5, CSS3,
* Backend - Node.js (Server-side language), SQLite (Database), passport.js(Authentication)
* Infrastructure - Docker, arbitrary cloud provider
